## Background

I am a quite a fan of Gumroad as a business platform. But honestly, their UI/UX kind of suck (please don't sue me). As my first submission to the #DailyUI challenge, I decided to start with re-designing their sign up and sign in page ‚ù§Ô∏è

I tried to keep the branding behind Gumroad by using their color theme and assets. I feel like they have really good points with their front page robot-human illustration and phrases like "Do More of What You Love", so I try to incorporate them to my design. I initially wanted to turn the illustration into a gif with small moving parts, but i spent too much time on this project already. Perhaps next time!
